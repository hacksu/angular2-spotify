# Angular 2 Spotify
A simple Angular 2 project written in Dart for HacKSU's 2/7/2017 meeting.

## Objectives
Learn some basics of Angular
* Routing
* Http Requests
* Rendering with ngIf and ngFor
* Pipes

Have fun with Dart because it's objectively an awesome language.

## Getting Started
1. [Install Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/install)
2. Clone the `master` branch of this repository (should be the main branch)
3. Run the following commands in the root of the repository  
   ```
    pub get

    pub serve
   ```
5. Navigate to localhost:8080

You should now have a pretty boring page with some text displaying.

Feel free to checkout the `release` branch to see what this project looks like completed.
